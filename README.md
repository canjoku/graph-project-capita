## Data structures
Used an undirected graph structure to hold nodes(locations) and weights(distances).

Use a priority queue DS to store visited nodes and weights during traversal.


## Algorithm
Use Djiksras path algorithm to determine shortest path

Use breath first to traverse priority queue and add up corresponding weights 


## Challenge/Issue.
Writting a traversal algorithm to traverse the pathObject datastructure, retrieve the interested weights and sum them up. 


## Thank You
I hope that this challenge has shown you my techincal style. I was unfortunately not able to bring the application to a fully working state by way of displaying the shorted distance. 

Some areas would probably have needed a bit more modularity but given this being a standalone app with no intentions of reuse, i have not overly seperated concerns.
