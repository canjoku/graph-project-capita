This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App].
This way i will not have to set up webpack. 

##Data structures
Used an undirected graph structure to hold nodes(locations) and weights(distances).

Use a priority queue DS to store visited nodes and weights during traversal.


#Algorithm
Use Djiksras path algorithm to determine shortest path

Use breath first to traverse priority queue and add up correspinding weights
